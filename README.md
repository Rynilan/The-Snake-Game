# Description

A simple snake game to learn how to work with GUI,  
how "animations" work, and to test my knowledge

# Background

While I tried to make a test of procedure animation, as I'm  
new to this programming world, it shown as a big challenge,  
soo, I stepped back and did a simpler thing, a snake game.

# How to play

## Running the game

Just clone the repository, enter on the folder and run the main.py  
file, don't worry, there's no malware or spyware on this. Then hit the  
button to play and enjoy.

## Controling the snake

Once the way that the snake was controlled was different of the clasical way,  
the buttons made it go to its right or its left, the foward movment is  
and still automatic, but now the arrow keys make the snake go to its literal  
direction, up, up, down, down and soo on.

## Losing

You lose when hit a wall or your own body, pretty standart.
