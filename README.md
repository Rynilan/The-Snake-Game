# Description

A simple snake game to learn how to work with GUI,  
how "animations" work, and to test my knowledge

# Background

While I tried to make a test of procedure animation, as I'm  
new to this programming world, it shown as a big challenge,  
soo, I stepped back and did a simpler thing, a snake game.

# How to play

## Running the game

Just clone the repository, enter on the folder and run the main.py  
file, don't worry, there's no malware or spyware on this. Then hit the  
button to play and enjoy (you can also use the numpad arrows, with the  
num lock disabled).

## Controling the snake

The way that the snake is controlled is different of the clasical way,  
the up arrow (num pad 8) make the snake go foward, right and left are  
there just to make the snake turn its direction.

## Losing

You lose when hit a wall or your own body.
